    description:
      "RaidHub is a showcase of my expertise across full-stack web development. It demonstrates my knowledge across the tech stack: front end, backend, cloud, continuous integration, and much more. As the primary developer on the team, I played a pivotal role in bringing RaidHub to life and maintaining the application.\n\nThe site is a centralized platform designed for the Destiny 2 gaming community, providing advanced in-game statistics, leaderboards for World First races, custom achievements, and more.\n\nThe cornerstone of the site is a robust REST API. This API connects to our highly optimized PostgreSQL database, managing over 600GB of connected records, including over 300 unique raid summaries and 20 million players. The scale of this database presents a massive technical hurdle, one we are proud to surpass.\n\nOur microservices written in Go form a solid infrastructure. Notably, our web crawler efficiently sends out over 250 web requests per second at peak times, updating the database with live records. This ensures players receive real-time updates on live activities, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.\n\nA message queue system built on RabbitMQ handles many post-processing tasks such as insertion into Clickhouse and fetching incomplete data.\n\nOn the front end, battled-tested TypeScript config serves as the bedrock for code reliability and early bug detection through well-defined linters and code formatters. We harness the power of Next.js through both server-side rendering and static generation in conjunction with Vercel's CDN to deliver fully hydrated pages from the edge, all optimized for SEO. The integration of tRPC streamlines communication between the front end and our serverless backend-for-the-frontend, resulting in type-safe data retrieval, input sanitization/validation, and a seamless developer experience. Additionally, industry standard tools such as react-query efficiently manage data caching mechanisms and optimizes performance for client-side data fetching, ensuring quick load times and enabling optimistic updates.",

The report includes statistics such as total playtime, favorite activities, and character usage. The app is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS and (framer) motion.\n\nThe site received visits from over 100,000 unique users within the first week of launch, and the project was featured across many game journalism websites. The official Destiny 2 Twitter account also shared the project, leading to a significant increase in traffic. The project was a great success, and I am proud of the work I put into it.",

We used the Chalice framework to deploy a static page to AWS lambda. The final model posts an RMSE of $160, which isfairly accurate.
